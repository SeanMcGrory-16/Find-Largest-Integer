# Find-Largest-Integer

## Objective
This project implements a Java program to efficiently find the largest integer in an array. It demonstrates fundamental array manipulation techniques and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding of array data structures and traversal  
- Implementing comparison-based search algorithms in Java  
- Optimizing performance for large datasets  

## Tools Used
- Java (for coding the algorithm)  
- Eclipse IDE (for development and debugging)  
- JUnit Testing (for verifying correctness of implementations)  

## Steps
1. Initialize an array with integer values  
2. Iterate through the array to compare values  
3. Track and update the largest integer found  
4. Output the result to the user
